<h2>2) Conclusion of the Contract</h2>

<p><b>2.1</b>&thinsp;The product descriptions in the Seller&rsquo;s online shop do not constitute binding offers on the part of the Seller, but merely serve the purpose of submitting a binding offer by the Client.</p>

<p><b>2.2</b>&thinsp;The Client may submit the offer via the online order form integrated into the Seller's online shop. In doing so, after having placed the selected goods and/or services in the virtual basket and passed through the ordering process, and by clicking the button finalizing the order process, the Client submits a legally binding offer of contract with regard to the goods and/or services contained in the shopping cart.</p>

<p><b>2.3</b>&thinsp;The Seller may accept the Client&rsquo;s offer within five days,</p>

<ul>
<li>by transferring a written order confirmation or an order confirmation in written form (fax or e-mail); insofar receipt of order confirmation by the Client is decisive, or</li>
<li>by delivering ordered goods to the Client; insofar receipt of goods by the Client is decisive, or</li>
<li>by requesting the Client to pay after he placed his order.</li>
</ul>

<p>Provided that several of the aforementioned alternatives apply, the contract shall be concluded at the time when one of the aforementioned alternatives firstly occurs. Should the Seller not accept the Client&rsquo;s offer within the aforementioned period of time, this shall be deemed as rejecting the offer with the effect that the Client is no longer bound by his statement of intent.</p>
