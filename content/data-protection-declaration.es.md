<h2>6) Use of Your Data for Direct Advertising</h2>

<p><b>6.1</b>&thinsp;If you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we will send you regular information about our offers. The only mandatory information for sending the newsletter is your e-mail address. The indication of additional possible data is voluntary and is used to allow us to address you personally. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure for sending newsletters. This means that we will not send you an e-mail newsletter, unless you have expressly confirmed to us that you agree to the sending of such a newsletter. We will then send you a confirmation e-mail asking you to confirm that you wish to receive future newsletters by clicking on an appropriate link.</p>

<p>By activating the confirmation link, you give us your consent to the use of your personal data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point a GDPR. When you register for the newsletter, we store your IP address entered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) as well as the date and time of registration so that we can trace any possible misuse of your e-mail address at a later time. The data collected by us when you register for the newsletter will be used exclusively for the purpose of advertising by means of the newsletter. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time via the link provided in the newsletter or by sending a message to the responsible person named above. After your cancellation, your e-mail address will immediately be deleted from our newsletter distribution list, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data in excess thereof, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this declaration.</p>

<p>Newsletter2GO uses this information to send and statistically evaluate newsletters on our behalf. For evaluation purposes, the e-mails sent contain so-called web beacons or tracking pixels, which represent single-pixel image files stored on our website. This allows us to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. With the help of the so-called conversion tracking, it can also be determined whether a pre-defined action (e.g. purchase of a product on our website) has taken place after clicking on the link in the newsletter. In addition, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type and operating system). The data is exclusively collected in a pseudonymized format and is not linked with your other personal data, thus preventing you from being identified. This data is exclusively used for statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.</p>

<p>If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter.</p>

<p>We have concluded an order processing agreement with Newsletter2Go obliging Newsletter2Go to protect our customers' data and not to pass it on to third parties.</p>

<h2>9) Online-Marketing</h2>

<p><b>9.1</b>&thinsp;Facebook pixels for creating custom audiences<br />

Within our online offer, the so-called &quot;Facebook pixel&quot; of the social network Facebook is applied. It is operated by Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Quare, Dublin 2, Ireland (hereinafter &quot;Facebook&quot;).<br />

If a user clicks on an advertisement placed by us, which is displayed on Facebook, an addition is added to the URL of our linked page by Facebook pixels. If our page allows data to be shared with Facebook via pixels, this URL parameter is written into the user's browser via a cookie, which is set by the linked page itself. This cookie is then read by Facebook Pixel and enables the data to be forwarded to Facebook.<br />

With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is able to determine visitors of our online offer as a target group for the presentation of ads (so-called &quot;Facebook ads&quot;). Accordingly, the Facebook pixel to display Facebook ads placed by us will be presented only to Facebook users who have shown an interest in our online offer or who demonstrate certain characteristics (e.g. interest in certain topics or products determined by means of the websites visited) which we will transmit to Facebook (so-called &quot;custom audiences&quot;). When using Facebook pixels, we also want to ensure that our Facebook ads match the potential interest of users and are not annoying. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by tracking whether users were forwarded to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (&quot;conversion&quot;).<br />

The collected data is anonymous and does not provide us with any information about the user&rsquo;s identity. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook to enable a connection to the respective user profile and to allow Facebook to use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Facebook Data Usage Guidelines ([https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ "https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/")). The data may enable Facebook and its partners to serve advertisements on and off Facebook.<br />

The data processing associated with the use of the Facebook pixel is based on our predominantly legitimate interest in the evaluation, optimization and economic operation of our online offer and our advertising measures in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR.<br />

The information generated by Facebook is usually transferred to a Facebook server and stored there. This may also result in transmission to the servers of Facebook Inc. in the USA. Facebook Inc. based in the USA is certified for the US-European data protection agreement &quot;Privacy Shield&quot;, which guarantees compliance with the data protection level applicable in the EU.<br />

If you want to object to the collection by Facebook pixels and the use of your data for presenting Facebook ads, you can set an opt-out cookie by clicking on the following link, which deactivates Facebook pixel tracking:<br />

<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="if (typeof fbpOptOut == 'function') { fbpOptOut(); } else { alert(atob('QUNIVFVVorzogRmVobGVuZGVyIEZhY2Vib29rLVBpeGVsIE9wdE91dC1Db2RlIQ==')); }">disable Facebook pixels</a><br />

This website also uses Google Analytics for a device-independent analysis of visitor flows, which is carried out via a user ID. When a page is accessed for the first time, the user is assigned a unique, permanent and anonymous ID, which is set across all devices. This makes it possible to assign interaction data from different devices and from different sessions to a single user. The User ID does not contain any personal data and does not transmit such data to Google. The collection and storage of data via the User ID can be revoked at any time with effect for the future. To do this, you must deactivate Google Analytics on all systems that you use, for example in another browser or on your mobile device.<br />

This website also uses Google Analytics' &quot;demographic features&quot; function. This allows reports to be generated that contain statements about demographic data such as age, gender and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-related advertising by Google, the Google Display Network, and visitor data from third-party providers. You can deactivate this function at any time via the ad settings in your Google Account or generally prohibit the collection of your data by Google Analytics as shown immediately below..<br />
